# relative [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/relative.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/relative)

> Get the relative filepath from path A to path B. Calculates from file-to-directory, file-to-file, directory-to-file, and directory-to-directory.

**Calculates correctly from:**

* file-to-directory
* file-to-file
* directory-to-file
* directory-to-directory


## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i relative --save
```


## Usage

```js
var relative = require('relative');
relative(from, to);

relative('a/b/c.txt', 'd');
//=> '../../d'

relative('d', 'a/b/c.txt');
//=> '../a/b/c.txt'
```

Relative to `process.cwd()`

```js
relative('a/b/c.txt');
//=> 'a/b/c.txt'

relative(process.cwd(), 'a/b/c.txt');
//=> 'a/b/c.txt'

relative('a/b/c.txt', process.cwd());
//=> '..'
```

### stat

There are cases where it is impossible to tell if a path is a file or a directory without more information.

**Examples**

If assume that `a.b.c` is a directory, we have no way of know that without hitting the filesystem, which is impossible if the path doesn't actually exist.

So the result would be:

```js
relative('fixtures/a.b.c', 'fixtures');
//=> '.'
```

**If the path exists**

Pass `true` as the last argument, or pass the stat object from `fs.stat()`/`fs.statSync()` and you will get the correct result.

```js
relative('fixtures/a.b.c', 'fixtures', true);
//=> '..'
```

**If the path does not exist**

End directory names with trailing slash. If you can't or don't want to do that, you may get incorrect results from time to time, but there isn't much we can do about it.

One very bad idea I had was to create a whitelist of filenames that look like directories, and directories that look like file names so that when those paths are encountered the logic would be adjusted accordingly. Anyway, it is what it is.


## relative.toBase()

Get the relative path to the given `base`.

```js
relative.toBase(base, filepath);
```

**Example**:

```js
relative.toBase('a/b', 'a/b/c/d/file.txt');
//=> 'c/d/file.txt'
```
